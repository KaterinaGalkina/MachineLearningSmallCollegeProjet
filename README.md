# Machine Learning Mini Project: Applications of PCA, SVD, and Linear Regression

Overview

This project is part of the coursework for Fondements du Machine Learning and is based on the exercises and practical sessions completed during the course. Here we are applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and Linear Regression to analyze and process data. 

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Compare image reconstructions using truncated SVD and PCA based on Frobenius norm and visual quality.
Analyze the effect of using a set of 9 images of the same individual for reconstruction, including tests with new images from the same or different individuals.

## Linear Regression

Evaluate errors with and without prior knowledge by adjusting dataset dimensions.
Study the impact of noise and Gaussian priors on regression models for different regularization parameters.

## Main Points Analyzed

How do PCA and SVD perform in reconstructing images, both quantitatively and visually?
How does the choice of image dataset affect reconstruction quality and generalization?
What is the effect of regularization and prior assumptions on linear regression error?
